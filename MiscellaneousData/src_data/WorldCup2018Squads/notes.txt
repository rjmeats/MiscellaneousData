Squads originally from BBC web site

4/6/2018, FIFA site provides PDF https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/qcuxk3y7c1ezwo5yylnn.pdf
- includes height and weight info too!

5/6/2018 Used Tableau import PDF / Union tables / export as CSV to produce FIFA_tables_from_PDF.csv
Needs further work to put into proper fields, but now more readily processed than as PDF format.

21/06/2018 Checked original link, doesn't work any more, the data is now at https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/hzfqyndmnqazczvc5xdb.pdf,
possibly slightly modified by Fifa ?
